.SH NAME
.PP
read-matrix - reads a matrix of points
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]read-matrix\f[R] [\f[B]--i\f[R] \f[I]FILE\f[R]] [\f[B]--o\f[R]
\f[I]FILE\f[R]] [\f[B]--delimiter\f[R]=\f[I]CHARACTER\f[R]]
[\f[B]--silent\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Reads a matrix of points, where each column corresponds to a distinct
dimension, and where each row represents a point.
.PP
Every line needs to start with floating point values, or it may be
entirely empty (nothing else).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \f[B]--i\f[R] \f[I]FILE\f[R], \f[B]--i\f[R]=\f[I]FILE\f[R]
Retrieves a point set from \f[I]FILE\f[R].
Its absence is substituted by \f[I]stdin\f[R].
.TP
.B \f[B]--o\f[R] \f[I]FILE\f[R], \f[B]--o\f[R]=\f[I]FILE\f[R]
Redirects the point set sequence to \f[I]FILE\f[R], opened in overwrite
mode (not appending mode).
Without \f[I]FILE\f[R], results are forwarded to \f[I]stdout\f[R].
Errors encountered during the program\[cq]s execution are streamed into
\f[I]stderr\f[R], and not into either \f[I]stdout\f[R] or
\f[I]FILE\f[R].
.TP
.B \f[B]--delimiter\f[R]=\f[I]CHARACTER\f[R]
A point set\[cq]s coordinates are separated by \f[I]CHARACTER\f[R],
while each point resides on a distinct line.
Recommended condition: \f[I]CHARACTER\f[R] = \[aq] \[aq],
\f[I]CHARACTER\f[R] = \[aq]\[rs]t\[aq].
.TP
.B \f[B]--silent\f[R]
Suppress comments in the output stream, yielding only the computed
value.
The latter could be the point set or its cardinality.
.SH LIMITATION
.PP
The algorithm requires a point set, not a point set sequence.
